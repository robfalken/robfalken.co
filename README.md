## Rob Falken's personal website

This is just the source code for my personal website [robfalken.co](https://robfalken.co/), it's probably not that interesting to anyone but me.

It's built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and their [Typography plugin](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography). Built and deployed to [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) using [GitHub actions](https://github.com/features/actions).
