If you are anything like me, you want to dive straight into builder mode when you have a new idea for a product. That is usually not the best idea. This article will give my rationale for why you should always start by hammering out a landing page. Only when you are happy with said landing page should you start building the actual product.


If your product is, in fact, new and innovative, then it is a no-brainer. Setting up a pre-launch landing page will start getting your work out there in front of potential customers. You can use it to validate your idea while you are busy building the product. I mean, let us face it. If you can’t even get people to sign up for early access at this point, then maybe they are just not feeling the pain the way you think they are? It will be even harder to convince them to hand over their credit card details when you have built the product and are ready to launch.


On the other hand, if your product is not a brand new idea. But merely an improved version of something already available in the market. Then, you might not get a lot of people signing up for early access. If they already feel the pain Today, they can buy something off the shelf and be over with it. They do not want to wait around for their early access slot to open up. In this case, you might not get a single sign up, and that is fine. You should still start with that pre-launch landing page!


Why? You might ask. Do not worry. I will get into that shortly. First, I would like to share my (not so secret) recipe for a product landing page.
First, the headline, where you call out the problem your audience is facing.Then, a subheading explaining how your product will fix the problem.Sprinkle 3-ish USP’s (or features) to support your subheading.Finish off with a call to action. In this case, it’s probably to sign up for early access or a newsletter to keep posted about future updates.
As you can see, the landing page’s content is all centered around the problem you are solving and how you are solving it. While this might sound easy and obvious, coming up with good copy for your landing page is often way harder than you might expect. The exercise of coming up with excellent copy will force you to think long and hard about the problem you are solving, who you are solving it for, and how you will solve it. It will guide you to build the right product and focus on the features that are most important to include in your first release.


That is why you should start out spending a lot of time thinking about the content of your pre-launch landing page before building the product, even when you believe it is not necessary. Because you are not necessarily doing it because you will get a lot of customers that way, but because the act of crafting it will be a good exercise in itself.


Hell, if you are lucky, you might even realize that your case is not as strong as you thought it was. And that you absolutely should not invest your soul and savings in building this particular product. It happened to me more than once, and I am happy it did. I would much rather find out this way than six months down the line when I launch my MVP to crickets.
