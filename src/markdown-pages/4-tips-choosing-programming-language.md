Or maybe you're the lucky senior engineer who has been assigned the task for an upcoming project. What if I get fired for selecting the wrong one?"

Sometimes we stand before the daunting task of choosing a programming language. It might be for your new start-up idea. What if it fails because I picked the wrong language? Or maybe you're the lucky senior engineer who has been assigned the task for an upcoming project. What if I get fired for selecting the wrong one?

If what you're about to create is just a side-project for fun, by all means, go crazy! No need to dwell on it. So for this scenario, I'll assume you have a business goal to achieve. 

# 1. Go with a language you like
This is my favorite. That's why I put it first. Programming should be fun, so make sure to pick a language you enjoy! If it's a team working on the project, pick something that the team will enjoy. Motivation won't always be 100%, so to work in a language you dread when motivation is already low might just be what kills the project.

# 2. Go with a language you know
Again, if this had been a side-project, anything would work. But there's a time for learning and a time for using your knowledge. Now that you have a goal to achieve, or a hypothesis to validate, using something familiar will get you there quicker.

# 3. Use tech you think you can recruit for
If the project takes off, chances are that you will have to recruit developers sooner or later. Your tech stack can be part of your recruitment strategy, and there are two very different ways to go about it. 

Either you pick a programming language with plenty of developers available. That's the safe road, but you can also use some exciting technology with fewer work opportunities to attract great developers looking for a chance to experiment with it.

How are you going to recruit? Are you active in any dev-communities? Elixir? Rust? Or something else? Great, go with that! If you are going to use an agency to recruit or outsource development, playing it safe with boring tech might be a wiser move. Otherwise, you might end up having to work with a highly niched, super expensive agency. And even they can have a hard time the right talent for your team.

# 4. Choose the right tool for the job
What is it that you are about to build, and to what end?

Do you have an idea you want to validate by building an MVP? Some languages and frameworks are just better suited for rapid prototyping. Personally, I'd go with Elixir/Phoenix if it's a web app. But Ruby/Rails would be another great alternative. Or if Node is more your thing, excellent. Whatever you think you think would allow you to build what you want to ship fastest is the answer. Not the most performant version of your idea or the most maintainable. Just fastest.

If you genuinely need your app to be performant. I mean, if speed is supposed to be your #1 USP, not just because "yeah, it has to be webscale because it might get tons of traffic a couple of years from now." Then, by all means, go with Go, Rust, or whatever performant tools you've got under your belt. Or if it's C++ because of points number 1,2, and 3, then that's great too!

Summary
Few projects depend on the right tech, so don't dwell on it. There are exceptions, of course. For example, if you are going to do machine learning, you are probably better off with Python. Give some thought to how you are going to recruit developers. But in general, just go with something you know and enjoy. And remember, Facebook was built in PHP!
